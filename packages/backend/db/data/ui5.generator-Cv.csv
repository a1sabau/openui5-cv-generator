1;Andrei;Sabau;andrei@asabau.com;+40724447749;Typescript Aficionado with 15+ Years FullStack Development Experience;"<p> I've been using <b>typescript</b> for both frontend and backend development for the last 7+ years. It has become my favorite web programming language as a replacement to javascript due to its strongly type nature. When it comes to SAP related development I am a <b>certified SAP NetWeaver ABAP developer</b> but haven't worked with it for about 10 years now. </p> <p> Due to SAP adding  javascript/typescript as an officially supported language for both frontend and backend development I am looking to get back into the field. Either as a frontend <b>SAPUI5/Fiori</b> developer or as full-stack with javascript/typescript <b>CAP</b> on the backend. </p>"
