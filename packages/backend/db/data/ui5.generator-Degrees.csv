A count-min sketch using a damped window model estimates stream density. Bloom filters employing a variation of active-active buffering estimate cluster membership. Instances of both types of sketches share the same set of hash functions. The resulting stream clustering algorithm is capable of detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters while correctly handling outliers and making no assumption on the total number of clusters. <br/> See <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02701"">Stream Clustering using Probabilistic Data Structures</a> and its <a href=""https://github.com/a1sabau/bloomstream"">R/C++</a> implementation.</p> <p>See <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=8zptmaEAAAAJ"">Google Scholar Account</a> for all publications.</p> </div>"
